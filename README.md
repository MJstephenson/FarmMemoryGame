# KIDS MEMORY GAMES PROJECT

![screenshot](docs/readme/responsive.png) ![screenshot](docs/readme/responsiveGames.png)

This is my first javascript project. I decieded to make the game from scratch rather than following a tutorial or a you-tube.com video so that I could gain as much knowledge about the javascript language and learn as I coded.  
I have built a card memory game that consits of three game styles, farm, space and cars. I chose these three themes as my little boy has a interest in all of them and I thought it would be fun to give him a choice when he played it. It would also be a good way to help with his memory skills and making 3 games would test my knowledge of using the DOM and what I have learnt from the Javascript modules in the code Institute course I am currently studying.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

- `#ffffff` used for primary text. This gives a strong contract between the text and all 4 backrounds used on the app.
- `#793568` used for button colour as this felt neutral and a good colour choice for all game styles. Matching the landing page backround image this makes the colours feel connected. I used code from [dev.to](https://dev.to/webdeasy/top-20-css-buttons-animations-f41) by [Kocsten](https://codepen.io/kocsten) for the button animation.
- `#6c757d` used for the instructions modal.
- `#05630a` used for winning modal to stand out from the softer colours used on the app to grab attention.
- `#000000` used for winning modal for a contrast colour for the winner modal animation.


- text-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #000000; box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px #000000; was used to make the text, buttons and cards pop and lift off the backgrounds.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/793568-6c757d-ffffff-000000-09e614) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I used Short Stack for the app font as it is a low contrast semi-geometric typeface inspired by childish written letters. It is sturdy, and clear but also whimsical and fun.

- [Short Stack](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Short+Stack) was used for all of the text throughout the app.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used on the site buttons and the github icon in the footer.

## Wireframes

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.

Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
